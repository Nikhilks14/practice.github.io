            Data models
        </h2>

        <p>
            Data Model gives us an idea that how the final system will look like after its complete implementation. It
            defines the data elements and the relationships between the data elements. Data Models are used to show how
            data is stored, connected, accessed and updated in the database management system. Here, we use a set of
            symbols and text to represent the information so that members of the organisation can communicate and
            understand it. Though there are many data models being used nowadays but the Relational model is the most
            widely used model. Apart from the Relational model, there are many other types of data models about which we
            will study in details in this blog. Some of the Data Models in DBMS are:-

        <ul>
            <li type="1"> Hierarchical Model</li>
            <li type="1">Network Model</li>
            <li type="1"></li>
            <li type="1"></li>
            <li type="1"></li>
            <li type="1"></li>
            <li type="1"></li>
            <li type="1"></li>
            <li type="1"></li>
            <li type="1"></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2> Entity-Relationship Model </h2>
        Entity-Relationship Model or simply ER Model is a high-level data model diagram. In this model, we represent the
        real-world problem in the pictorial form to make it easy for the stakeholders to understand. It is also very
        easy for the developers to understand the system by just looking at the ER diagram. We use the ER diagram as a
        visual tool to represent an ER Model. ER diagram has the following three components:

        <ul>
            <li> <strong> Entities: </strong> Entity is a real-world thing. It can be a person, place, or even a concept. Example: Teachers, Students, Course, Building, Department, etc are some of the entities of a
            School Management System.</li>

            <li>
                <strong>Attributes: </strong>
                 An entity contains a real-world property called attribute. This is the characteristics of that attribute. Example: The entity teacher has the property like teacher id, salary, age, etc.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Relationship: </strong>
                Relationship tells how two attributes are related. Example: Teacher works for a department.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
