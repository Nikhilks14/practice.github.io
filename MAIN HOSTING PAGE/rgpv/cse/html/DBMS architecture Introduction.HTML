        <h1>DBMS architecture Introduction</h1>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The DBMS design depends upon its architecture. The basic client/server architecture is used to deal with
                a large number of PCs, web servers, database servers and other components that are connected with
                networks.
            </li>
            <li>
                DBMS architecture depends upon how users are connected to the database to get their request done.

            </li>
            <li>
                The client/server architecture consists of many PCs and a workstation which are connected via the
                network.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2> Types of DBMS Architecture --- add image</h2>
        <p>

            Database architecture can be seen as a single tier or multi-tier. But logically, database architecture is of
            two types like: 2-tier architecture and 3-tier architecture.
        <h3 style="color: red;">
            1-Tier Architecture ---------add image
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In this architecture, the database is directly available to the user. It means the user can directly sit
                on the DBMS and uses it.

            </li>

            <li>
                Any changes done here will directly be done on the database itself. It doesn't provide a handy tool for
                end users.
            </li>

            <li>
                The 1-Tier architecture is used for development of the local application, where programmers can directly
                communicate with the database for the quick response.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: red;">
            2-Tier Architecture --- add image
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 2-Tier architecture is same as basic client-server. In the two-tier architecture, applications on
                the client end can directly communicate with the database at the server side. For this interaction,
                API's like: ODBC, JDBC are used.

            </li>

            <li>
                The user interfaces and application programs are run on the client-side.

            </li>

            <li>
                The server side is responsible to provide the functionalities like: query processing and transaction
                management.
            </li>

            <li>
                To communicate with the DBMS, client-side application establishes a connection with the server side.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: red;">
            3-Tier Architecture --- add image
        </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The 3-Tier architecture contains another layer between the client and server. In this architecture,
                client can't directly communicate with the server.
            </li>

            <li>
                The application on the client-end interacts with an application server which further communicates with
                the database system.
            </li>

            <li>
                End user has no idea about the existence of the database beyond the application server. The database
                also has no idea about any other user beyond the application.
            </li>

            <li>
                The 3-Tier architecture is used in case of large web application.
            </li>

        </ul>
        </p>
